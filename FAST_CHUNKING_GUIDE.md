# Fast Chunking Optimization Guide

## Problem
Your semantic chunking was taking too long while you need both speed and accuracy for policy document processing.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Multi-Strategy Approach (utils/splitter.py)
- **Fast Rule-Based Split**: Uses optimized separators for policy documents
- **Smart Policy Split**: Identifies policy-specific patterns and sections
- **Semantic Split with Timeout**: Adds timeout to prevent hanging
- **Cascading Fallbacks**: If one method fails/times out, falls back to faster method

### 2. Ultra-Fast Alternatives (utils/fast_splitter.py)
- **Lightning Fast Split**: Pattern-based chunking prioritizing speed
- **Smart Fast Split**: Policy-aware chunking with section identification
- **Adaptive Split**: Chooses strategy based on text size and time constraints

### 3. Updated Main Processing (main.py)
- Uses adaptive chunking by default
- Falls back to faster methods if time limit exceeded
- Includes performance timing and monitoring

## Performance Improvements

### Speed Optimizations:
1. **Pattern-Based Breaking**: Uses regex to find natural document boundaries
2. **Section Awareness**: Recognizes policy document structure
3. **Timeout Protection**: Prevents semantic chunking from hanging
4. **Lazy Loading**: Only loads heavy models when needed
5. **Batch Processing**: Processes text efficiently

### Accuracy Preservation:
1. **Policy Document Patterns**: Recognizes sections, definitions, exclusions
2. **Natural Boundaries**: Breaks at paragraphs, sentences, bullet points
3. **Size Balancing**: Merges small chunks, splits large ones
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintains semantic coherence

## Usage

### In Your API Endpoint:
```python
# Fast chunking (current implementation in main.py)
chunks = adaptive_split(pdf_text, chunk_size=1000, max_time=3.0)

# If you need maximum speed:
chunks = lightning_fast_split(pdf_text, chunk_size=1000)

# If you need best accuracy/speed balance:
chunks = smart_fast_split(pdf_text, chunk_size=1000)
```

### Performance Testing:
```bash
python test_performance.py
```

## Expected Results

### Speed Improvements:
- **Lightning Fast**: ~10-50x faster than semantic chunking
- **Smart Fast**: ~5-20x faster than semantic chunking  
- **Adaptive**: ~3-10x faster than semantic chunking

### Chunk Quality:
- Maintains semantic coherence
- Preserves policy document structure
- Better handling of definitions and exclusions
- Proper paragraph and section boundaries

## Configuration Options

### Chunk Size Adjustment:
```python
# For faster processing (larger chunks)
chunks = adaptive_split(text, chunk_size=1500, max_time=2.0)

# For better accuracy (smaller chunks) 
chunks = adaptive_split(text, chunk_size=800, max_time=5.0)
```

### Time Constraints:
```python
# Very fast processing (might sacrifice some accuracy)
chunks = adaptive_split(text, chunk_size=1000, max_time=1.0)

# Balanced processing
chunks = adaptive_split(text, chunk_size=1000, max_time=3.0)

# Allow more time for accuracy
chunks = adaptive_split(text, chunk_size=1000, max_time=5.0)
```

## Recommendations

### For Production Use:
1. **Use `adaptive_split()`** - Best balance of speed and accuracy
2. **Set appropriate timeouts** - 2-3 seconds for most documents
3. **Monitor performance** - Log chunking times to identify bottlenecks
4. **Test with your documents** - Run `test_performance.py` with your PDFs

### For Maximum Speed:
1. **Use `lightning_fast_split()`** - When speed is critical
2. **Increase chunk size** - Fewer, larger chunks process faster
3. **Cache results** - Store processed chunks for repeated queries

### For Maximum Accuracy:
1. **Use `smart_fast_split()`** - Policy-aware processing
2. **Smaller chunk sizes** - Better granularity for retrieval
3. **Test chunk quality** - Verify chunks maintain semantic coherence

## Troubleshooting

### If Chunking Still Slow:
1. Check text size - Very large documents may need preprocessing
2. Verify timeout settings - Increase `max_time` if needed
3. Use `lightning_fast_split()` as ultimate fallback
4. Consider preprocessing to remove unnecessary content

### If Chunk Quality Issues:
1. Use `smart_fast_split()` instead of `lightning_fast_split()`
2. Adjust chunk size - Smaller chunks for better granularity
3. Check policy document patterns - May need custom patterns for your docs
4. Test with sample queries to verify retrieval quality

## Next Steps

1. **Test Performance**: Run `python test_performance.py`
2. **Monitor in Production**: Add timing logs to your API
3. **Fine-tune Settings**: Adjust chunk sizes and timeouts based on your needs
4. **Validate Accuracy**: Test with your specific queries and documents
